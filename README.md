# Prolog
These are three simple Prolog programs.

## Requirements
**SWI-Prolog**

## Run
```
$ swipl -q -s xxx.pl
```

## Usage
1. Goldbach's conjecture
    * Input: One even integer greater than 2.
    * Output: Two prime integers and their sum is the input integer.

2. Lowest Common Ancestor
    * Input: First, input a number N (N nodes in the tree). Next, input N-1 pairs of two nodes (N-1 edges in the tree). Then, input a number Q (# of queries). Last, input Q pair of two nodes (the queries).
    * Output: Q nodes (the LCA of your M queries).

3. Connected
    * Input: First, input N (# of nodes) and E (# of edges). Next, input E pairs of nodes (the edges). Then, input Q (# of quries) and Q pairs of nodes (the quries).
    * Output: Q results (Yes or No).
